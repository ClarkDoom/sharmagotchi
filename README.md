This is an app inspired by my two charming but very needy Shar Pei. Owning a pet is hard work but its also fun and rewarding, which inspired me to model what it sometimes feels like with my app. Its a constant fight against the clock to make sure they're fed, well rested, taken out, and have got enough play time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
