This is an app inspired by my two charming but very needy Shar Pei. Owning a pet is hard work but its also fun and rewarding, which inspired me to model what it sometimes feels like with my app. Its a constant fight against the clock to make sure they're fed, well rested, taken out, and have got enough play time.<br><br><br>

## Goal of the Game: Raise your own digital pet and ensure they are happy and healthy. 
  
  - Enter a name for your newly adopted Sharmagotchi to begin the game.
  - Raise your pet's health meter to full by interacting with them.
  - Play with your pet to increase their food supply.
  - Don't let your pet's hunger, bladder, or sleepy meter get too full or their health meter will go down.
  - If your health meter reaches 0, your pet will play dead, pass out from exhaustion, or be too sad to continue being your pet and you must reset the game.

## Features: 
* True to life mechanics such as eating, sleeping, going # 1, and playing.
* Game alerts that catch your attention.
