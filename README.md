### Your new favorite pet simulator. 

This is an app inspired by my favorite pups in the world. Owning a pet is hard work but its also fun and rewarding, which inspired me to model what it sometimes feels like with my app. Its a constant fight against the clock to make sure they're fed, well rested, taken out, and have got enough play time. 


## Getting Started 

Goal of the Game: Raise your own digital pet and ensure they are happy and healthy. 
  
  - Enter a name for your newly adopted Sharmagotchi.
  - Raise your pet's health meter to full by interacting with them.
  - Play with your pet to increase their food supply.
  - Don't let your pet's hunger, bladder, or sleepy meter get too full or their health meter will go down.
  - REMEMBER: Pets need constant attention!
